 ethic_notice.1.desc:0 "Paradox, I'm going to fuck you. If you don't want players to play MOD, don't open MOD making. Is it interesting to set the game launcher to modify the path and cause the MOD update to be invalid? You should be thankful that I still want to make something for my friends. If you don't change your stupid starter, you don't want to receive energy from me in future DLCs. You are forcing me to spend unity to buy DLC."
