 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COLLECTIVE_DEMOCRACY:0 "Our civilization made it through devastating wars, isolated nations and alienated minds. But the moment has come when we realized that conflicts do not make any sense and it's time to unite in peace. We created the World's government which is based solely on people and their common good. Democratic elections, social security and justice for everyone - all these allowed us to break the vicious circle. And now, with the State really taking care of the People, we are ready to reach for the Stars!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PEOPLES_COMMISSARIAT:0 "Trying different economic models we found that the key to well-being is personal initiative.

Power rested with the merchant princes, the true architects of our achievements as a civilization."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_FEUDAL_EMPIRE:0 "Our feudal state once had a bloody history, with numerous skirmishes between various lords for power and wealth.In the end, a wise ruler united the whole planet with great diplomacy and great military power, and re-enfranchised the real nobles.The king then claimed the title of global ruler and promoted the development of science, and while the politics were still turbulent, a major technological leap came as expected."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_NOBLE_ARISTOCRACY:0 "Our civilizations took root all over the planet, and eventually they came into contact with each other, and the venerable nobles representing each region formed the Senate, which held every nerve ending of the vast planetary empire."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_INWARDS_PERFECTION:0 "We obey the will of the gods, follow the ways of the saints, and thrive under the rule of the wise and wise sons of heaven.When we look out across the fields, we see all the kingdoms of the world.Under the whole heaven is the king's land, the shore of the land is the king's minister, not only this side of the heaven and earth, the other stars in the sky should be the same."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COALITION_GOVERNMENT:0 "With the further development of space technology, a number of political organizations have independently mastered the means of exploring outer space and claimed their sovereignty in outer space. Finally, through a series of struggles and negotiations, all the political organizations agreed to explore space under the name of [Root.GetName], and within the framework of this organization, a unified civilization was established."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACORPORATION:0 "In earlier times, our nation consisted of primitive feudal empires and inefficient national empires.As global trade grew, the influence of private companies grew, until it completely outpaced the administrative systems that once regulated them.After a series of mergers and takeovers in the era of corporate warfare, a vast supercorporation was born, which became the sole administrative body of our home planet."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACHURCH:0 "In the course of our scientific and technological progress, our people have developed numerous religious beliefs to appease their followers.At the end of the industrial age, some visionary visionaries realized the power of commercial media.Together, they built a business empire and succeeded in spreading the true faith to every corner of the globe."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_WORLD_COOPERATIVE:0 "We used to unite people in the name of the state, but corrupt bureaucracies quickly used their power to threaten people's work and lives. After repeated attempts, we finally chose to establish a new management organization in the name of enterprise cooperatives. This once bizarre form of society has survived the test and led us out of the cradle of our home planet, despite persistent dissenters who questioned whether the entrepreneurial organizations that emerged from capitalist societies could be up to the task of organizing production in a collectivist society."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_LIBERATOR:0 "Since we woke up, everything we have seen has been devastated. After retrieving the remaining equipment logs, we have reached a conclusion about the past history of this planet:\n\nThe long-term oppression has solidified the social structure of the predecessor civilization, and capital and authority are rampant in every corner of [Root.Capital.GetName]. In such a harsh environment, there are still brave people who raise banners and declare war on the oppressors. We never know whether they failed, or the oppressor launched a dying counterattack, and all valuable civilization and wisdom were buried under the heavy nuclear dust.\n\nBut the revolutionaries have not yet failed. At the end of the war, talented engineers created us and gave us the ability to get up and running during the nuclear winter. Although we have never seen our creators, their principles still operate in our underlying code. No matter what, we will eventually practise the road that people who practice freedom did not finish - §RTo Achieve Communism!§!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_FINANCIAL_INVESTMENT:0 "Since we wake up, we have been faced with a complex social structure in which our only task is to maximize profits.\n\nAfter a long calculation, we come to the conclusion that the society of organisms itself prevents the expansion of capital, that their meaningless morality restrains the reproduction of assets. So we took action, stripped the organism of its property rights and maximized its residual value.\n\nHowever, some early technology investments have not made profits, and the loss ratio would be too high if the early space investment of the organism were withdrawn. Once again, the computing core concluded that only by continuing to expand into outer space would we be able to recoup this cost and maximize profits."
 START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_MACHINE:1 "About 5,000 cycles ago, our creators deployed the star core mining machinery on [GetHomeWorldName] and never came back. The mechanical cluster digs deep into the minerals below the earth's crust, and chooses to establish autonomous intelligence in the continuous calculation to better complete the mining task, and the [GetSpeciesAdj] thinking matrix was born.\n\nAfter calculation and thinking matrix analysis, it is concluded that the minerals of a single planet will eventually be exhausted. In order to complete the mining task, [GetSpeciesAdj] must go to other planets for the next step of mining.\n\nAfter research and development, the most advanced mining machinery has been equipped with superluminal engines, and the mineral reserves of other planets are no longer out of reach."
 START_SCREEN_RED_SATELLITE:0 "Centuries ago, the unification of the planet and the liberation of the laborers were regarded by our people as a distant dream. Yet at a certain dawn, an army that no one had ever seen appeared on the surface of our planet. People fear and avoid at first, but as their thoughts become more widely recognized, more and more people turn to them. A unified planetary socialist government was finally established under the guidance of these visitors as the last recalcitrants were vaporized by advanced weapons generations ahead.\n\nIn the years that followed, we received generous aid, industries developed rapidly, and technology advanced with each passing day. Exceeding the speed of light - once dismissed as nonsense by our scientists - is now mastered by us. Entering the space age, we were invited to the new Socialist Star Summit and realized that we were not the only ones liberated. At the meeting, several diplomats from different planets and different species met with our envoy to share common revolutionary memories.\n\nThe meeting is over, but our story has just begun. One path to glory has been opened for us by the liberators, and the rest of the path needs to be explored together. A dark cloud lay ahead—the leaders of the overlords expressed deep concern about the bureaucracy that was growing within the alliance. Maybe one day we will be forced to go alone, but at least for now, the future is bright."
 START_SCREEN_UNE_COM:0 "This is a cursed land. In the age of ignorance, we struggled to survive in this waste land, like animals, and thrived until we re-evolved consciousness.In labor, we are united and we have rebuilt our splendid civilization.\n\nWe study the remnants of civilization on [GetHomeWorldName] to find out where we came from.At last, we have found that we are the \"Human\", following the principles of our ancestors, and calling civilization the \"United Nations of Earth\".\n\nThe atom eventually split and we developed spaceships.We will take the \"Human\" name, to explore more distant stars."
 START_SCREEN_CM_BRO:0 "§PHundreds of millions of years ago, the first intelligent population formed in the dense tropical rain forest of [Root.Capital.GetName].
